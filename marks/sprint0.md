## summary.md

**total mark**: 6/8

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|project objectives have been specified clearly|2|2|
|key users have been identified clearly|1|2|
|scenarios have been described clearly|2|2|
|principles have been describled clearly|1|2|

**additional comments**:
- would have liked to see more scenarios
	- you can have more scenarios for each type of user to list out all the cases for your application
    - being more detailed here and having more examples will give you a better scope when it comes to making the project
- I don't think 2 marks is worth 'see personas.pdf'
	- key users are more general personas, and do not represent a specific person but rather a subgroup of users with different needs and wants to be satisfied by the system
- key principals a bit lacking
	- key principals are usually a couple words, followed by some explanation
	- no proof of how these key principals will be achieved

## competition.md

**total mark**: 2/2

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|competition has been identified clearly|x|2|

**additional comments**:

## product backlog pb.md and jira

**total mark**: 7/8

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|sufficient stories to occupy team for release|2|2|
|relevant persona clearly identified for each user story|2|2|
|all user stories identify goal/desire and identify why/benefit|1|2|
|writing|2|2|

**additional comments**:

- some user stories are missing the why component
	- i.e. As a user (Jessica), I want to receive updates on courses I have looked at if they become offered for free.
	- i.e. As a member of a NPO (Josephine), I want to ask for volunteers and provide volunteer experience or employment through the Giving Garden.
- user stories are missing point estimates
- good job on breaking down user stories to specific tasks

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|team organization (roles) divided clearly|1|2|
|decision making|1|2|
|prioritizing user stories|2|2|
|meetings|1|2|
|next phase|2|2|

**additional comments**:
- for team organization, roles are not divided clearly. Who is doing front end, back end, writeups, scrum master, presenter for software demos etc
- for meetings,
	- time of day to meet?
	- what if someone is not able to attend?
	- what if someone misses a meeting they agreed to?
	- what is the criteria to determine if the meeting was effective?
		- ineffective meetings happen a lot!
	- standups vs meetings
- for decisions, needs more details on how the criteria would work for your team
	- what if some one strongly opposes a decision but does not have the voting power to win?
		- i.e. algo god made to work on front end stuff
- try to think about assigning responsibilities directly to specific team members
    - e.g. try to assign accountability for completing certain tasks to certain team members

## user experience

**total mark**: 4/4

|category|mark|total|
|user experience is logically related to scenarios (from summary.md)|2|2|
|graphic representation is clear and represents well intended user interface elements|2|2|

**additional comments**:
- in the sprint0 handout under user experience: "Use whichever format youâ€™d like, just make it easy for the TA to evaluate."
	- this was a pain in the ass to look at, UX for viewer = -inf
		- it's great that you guys went through his mockups and found what you guys liked and didn't like, but I only need to see that the UX is logically related to scenarios, not 100 comments
