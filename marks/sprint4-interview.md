**additional comments**:

- the published quizzes could be more UI friendly
	- if i want to see which ones are published, I have to click on the quiz and see if the button is checked off
- great progress, I saw a lot of new stuff, and the "unique" analytics and endorsements come together for all the roles
- work on the "golden path" we talked about, -1 for this
