# Retro:

## What we learned from this sprint:
- Waking up early for standup every day is hard
- Case is really bad at waking up 

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Pinging people for review made it happen much quicker (and lets more people get code review experience)
- Start working on tickets early and ask for help immediately on discord once you get stuck

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
- We’re pretty happy with our progress so far, and hope to close off the project doing what we’re doing

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
- Forgot to retest my code after some discussion in PR request, should always retest after any changes
- Pushing changes that break a majority of unit tests 

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2 
[BEST]
- Ashraful said our demo was good and he liked it so we’re basically geniuses :smile:

[WORST]
- everyone was late for retro :(
