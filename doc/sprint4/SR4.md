# Retro:

## What we learned from this sprint:
- We need a “Golden Path” so that our demo doesn't break :(
- Maintaining tests across frontend  / backend use cases is hard to do 

## What are we going to do for the presentation
- Set our demo path so that it is replicable 
- We want *real* data for the demo, and have a predetermined script so things go smoothly

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 4 
[BEST]
- I made the profile pictures look nice :)
- Got some cool features done allowing us to see more doggo profile pictures :)
- Integrating a lot of features into one thing

[WORST]
- Login borked :(
- I have 8 assignments due in 7 days :/ :) :/
