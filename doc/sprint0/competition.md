Course Content:

E-learning platforms all contain a variety of available courses. Skillshare, Masterclass, and Lynda all have a similar position. They offer content mostly centered around art and design, computer science, business, and mental wellness. Most of their courses are between 10 minutes and 3 hours long, meaning the bulk of their courses are not designed to be taken over long periods of time. Monthly is centered on art and design, but the courses are longer and meant to extend over a month. Udemy and Coursera offer the largest range of topics, still focusing mainly on the previously mentioned topics. <br>
<br>
None of these platforms seems to cater towards the social-innovation sector like U Impactify does. Many of the courses are directed at individuals looking to further their career, improve at a hobby, or improve their overall well-being. On top of that, many of the courses already apply to courses or majors you could take or learn about via traditional education streams. U Impactify caters more to social-initiatives who require niche skills in a niche field. The demographic is not large enough for the aforementioned platforms to focus on, and U Impactify seeks to consolidate all the education for members of that demographic.<br>

Course Interaction:

Udemy, Coursera, Skillshare, Masterclass, and Lynda all have a very disconnected model when it comes to student-instructor interaction. Instructors on these platforms create their courses to reach as large and wide-ranging an audience as possible. When a student takes any of the majority of the courses on these websites, there is no expectation that the instructor will interact with them in any way. There are effectively interactive textbooks, providing a library resource in the form of reading and video materials. There is then a possibility of quizzes or assignments and then the student has completed the course. <br>
<br>
Monthly is the only website that goes against this model. Courses on Monthly are designed to run synchronously, allowing the instructor to actually communicate in real time with students and adjust the course to their needs. <br>
<br>
U Impactify is in a unique position. The courses and training it aims to give are niche enough that smaller audiences than Udemy or Coursera are expected. As a result, it is possible to adjust a course or courses to feedback as it is received. U Impactify will also offer a mix of synchronous and asynchronous courses. This allows users to learn at their own pace if they wish or learn alongside peers at a set schedule and communicate with their instructors in both scenarios.

Payment and Finances:

MasterClass, Lynda, and Skillshare all offer subscription based payment plans. The subscription is a pass that allows the user to access premium content on their platform. All of the other content is free and can be accessed by any user. <br>
Monthly, Coursera, and Udemy charge per-course. Each course costs a certain amount depending on how long it is and the depth of the content. In both cases instructors are paid based on a combination of royalties based on how long their courses are watched, how many students they reach, and overall site-wide engagement. <br>
<br>
Even though the payment methods for these sites differ, all of them offer free courses and can offer users free access to paid content. U Impactify puts much more emphasis on this aspect. Because the entire focus of the site is social initiatives, offering services for free is an integrable part of the platform. Most instructors on other sites aim to pad their income or get their entire income from their courses. U Impactify does pay its instructors, but its main focus is to provide services to the groups that need it in the form of volunteer work, free education, or employment opportunities.<br>
