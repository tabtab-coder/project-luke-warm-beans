- Tools:  Google Docs, Discord, Jira

- Due to covid, we can't meet in person, and in addition to that some members are out of Canada, living at different time zones. Therefore we meet online using discord.(maybe we can add Jira after tut2)

- As a group, we decided to meet three times per week, one at the beginning of a sprint, one at the end and one after the tutorial as we all attend the same tutorial. This way, we can communicate what to do before the sprint starts and at the end to see what problems occurred and how we can assure the next sprint will be smoother.

- Decisions are made after discussing as a group and if the majority favors an idea, it is the one we go on with.

- Mainly discord is used to keep track of everything whether it is update on work, or if someone will miss a meeting. We use multiple text channels to keep track in an organized fashion.

- We define priority as how long a task will take and to decide we used scrum poker. Number of rounds depends on how scattered the numbers are, unless all vote scores are +/- 1 range of majority we keep on having scrum poker and after every score viewing, we explain why we think this way so that we can come to a common ground.

- Organization: We split the team overall into frontend / backend to get a general sense of who would be doing what work.

>Lesson of the sprint: we should be clear on what the start time will be for a meeting, especially if it can change week by week.
