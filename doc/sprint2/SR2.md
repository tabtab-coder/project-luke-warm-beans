# Retro:

## We split responsibilities from tickets:
- We mostly kept to our original plan
- Decided to remove content creation from sprint2 to allow capacity for bug fixing and improved code quality [LUK-32 Add new quizzes and assignments as teacher for students]

## What we learned from this sprint:
- Proper authentication handling on the frontend
- Authentication usage with mongodb
- how to send bad request from the server and handle them on frontend

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Continuing having regular meetings and doing quality code reviews as before to maintain good communication and quality of code base
- Continuing using good authentication practices on frontend
- Being aware of our current capacity and upcoming deadlines allows us to deliver our user stories on time ;)

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
- Setting better expectations for task completion times to work off each other better 
- Communicate dependencies and their estimated completion so that others can also finish their work in a timely manner
- Better distribution of code review
- We will @ people for code review

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
- waiting until right before demo to put up a PR
- members not knowing frontend
- merging branches into dev without running `npm test`

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2 
- [BEST] team bonding on discord
- [WORST] dealing with leftover errors from sprint1
